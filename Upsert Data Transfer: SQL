-- For SQL Server, the preferred method for performing an upsert is using the MERGE statement.

MERGE INTO destination_table AS dest
USING source_table AS src
    ON dest.id = src.id  -- condition to match records between source and destination tables -- this is usually the PK, but not always.

WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET 
        dest.column1 = src.column1,
        dest.column2 = src.column2,
        dest.column3 = src.column3,

        -- Add additional columns as needed
        dest.updated_at = GETDATE()  -- Use GETDATE() to update timestamp (or CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
    INSERT (id, column1, column2, column3, created_at)
      VALUES (src.id, src.column1, src.column2, src.column3, GETDATE());
